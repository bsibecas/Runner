# Runner

Runner is one of the first video games that I programmed using the C language. The main goal of the project was to create a video game based on the Endless Running game rules. You will have character who can move with the arrows to avoid the obstacles that you will find during the game. The project was fully made with the CSFML library.

USAGE:
./my_runner

GOAL:
You are a ghost that is following his way when he found some enemies. 
Try to avoid them, you have three chances before the ghost has to change his way.
