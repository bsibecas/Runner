# Runner

Runner is one of the first video games that I programmed using the C language and the CSFML library. The main goal of the project was to create a video game based on the Endless Running game rules. You will have a character who have to avoid some obstacles all along the game. For that you will need to use the arrows that allows you to move the sprite up and down the screen.

USAGE:
./my_runner

GOAL:
You are a ghost that is following his way when he found some enemies. 
Try to avoid them, you have three chances before the ghost has to change his way.
